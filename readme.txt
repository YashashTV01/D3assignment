Uk Cities ploting on map 
In this project mainly we are using d3.js for the visualization and we are fetching data from uk.json and than it will locate on the map 
i have also designed tool tip which helps to show using hower county,population,longitutde ,latitude of the city 
I have 3 files index.html , index.css, index.js 
I have used external styling using css and i have linked using <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css">
I have also linked .js file using  <script src="index.js"></script> 
I have also linked the library d3.js using <script type="text/javascript" src="./d3.v4.js"></script>
If we want to run the webpage we need to click on Open with Live server in index.html (I am using Visual studio)
